There was a time that the mobile app for LastPass was pay to use. I started looking into LastPass alternatives and found that there are many password managers that are much more secure. That said, it&rsquo;s worth noting that LastPass <em>is</em> secure.</p><p>I was looking for a password manager that was easy to use across devices (mobile support is important to me), that allows me to export my passwords as a file, is open sourced and actively developed. A password manager that is open sourced and actively developed means that any security vulnerabilities could be quickly addressed and any privacy concerns could be audited by folks who can follow through the source code. This means that the interests of the users are above any kind of interest when it comes to making money (since it&rsquo;s truly free).</p><h1 id=password-manager-of-choice>Password manager of choice</h1><p>I ended up choosing <a href=https://keypassxc.org>KeePassXC</a> as my password manager of choice. The reason I chose <a href>KeePassXC</a> over KeePass (or other forks) is because <a href=https://keypassxc.org>KeePassXC</a> is actively developed and it&rsquo;s written in C++ (as opposed to C#, which means that it can natively compile across different operating systems).</p><p>I downloaded the latest version of <a href=https://keepasdsxc.org/download/>KeePassXC</a> on my desktop, where I would initially migrate my passwords.</p><h1 id=exporting-passwords-from-lastpass>Exporting passwords from LastPass</h1><p>In order to get <a href=https://keypassxc.org>KeePassXC</a> up and running, I wanted to migrate my passwords from LastPass.</p><p><a href=https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/how-do-i-nbsp-export-stored-data-from-lastpass-using-a-generic-csv-file>LastPass offers the ability to export your Vault</a>. Download the CSV into an easy to remember location, because this will be used to import your passwords.</p><h1 id=importing-into-keepassxc>Importing into KeePassXC</h1><p>When you create a database in KeePass, you have to specify where you want to store the database. The database is an encrypted file that is stored in your operating system. This will be helpful if you want to sync it to a cloud provider.</p><p>In KeePassXC, go to:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Database -&gt; Import -&gt; Import CSV File
</code></pre><p>Select the CSV generated above <strong>but do not import yet! The format of LastPass&rsquo;s CSV does not conform to the default mapping KeePassXC specifies.</strong> Make sure that you confirm what the import looks like in the preview window. At the time of writing, I used the following mapping:</p><table><thead><tr><th>column name</th><th>LastPass column</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Group</td><td>column 6</td></tr><tr><td>Title</td><td>column 5</td></tr><tr><td>Username</td><td>column 2</td></tr><tr><td>Password</td><td>column 3</td></tr><tr><td>Url</td><td>column 1</td></tr><tr><td>Notes</td><td>column 4</td></tr><tr><td>Last Modified</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Created</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Once the mapping looks okay, import the passwords.</p><h1 id=cloud-sync>Cloud Sync</h1><p>I personally used Google Drive to backup my KeePass database. I installed Google Drive, created a folder in Google Drive, selectively chose only that folder for sync (I don&rsquo;t want to sync all my Drive to my computers), and dropped the KeePass database in there. This functionality is cross platform compatible, and totally free (granted, I&rsquo;m using Google for cloud storage). This step is critical for mobile support.</p><h1 id=mobile-support>Mobile Support</h1><p>I&rsquo;m an iOS user that has a Windows desktop. This means that I don&rsquo;t really get the tight mobile/desktop integration that Apple provides. That said, there are only two things to worry about to make sure mobile support is provided:</p><ul><li>Being able to download the KeePass database from the cloud</li><li>A program to load the KeePass database</li></ul><p>I found <a href=https://strongboxsafe.com/>Strongbox</a> to be the best iOS app to use. It allows for both a local KeePass database in iOS as well as support for multiple cloud providers (including iCloud).</p><p>I connected the application to my Google Drive, and loaded up the keypass database. This allowed me to view all my passwords in Strongbox, which meant that the mobile integration was basically done.</p><p>The last step to complete the mobile integration was enabling the iOS feature to have Strongbox fill in my passwords. To do so, I did the following:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Settings -&gt; Passwords -&gt; AutoFill Passwords -&gt; Strongbox
</code></pre><p>Once enabled, any password prompt will source passwords from the KeePass database.</p><h1 id=closing-thoughts>Closing thoughts</h1><p>I like that this is all free, and is using open source tools. The only questionable bit of this is the cloud sync, which could be safer by using a privacy focused cloud provider such as <a href=https://nextcloud.com/>NextCloud</a>.</p><p>That said, this requires a bit of configuration to get going. I think if I had an Apple-based desktop/laptop, I would just use the native Apple password manager, as it&rsquo;s built into all their products and syncs across your iCloud.</p></div><div class=pagination><a href=/til/fzf-vim/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
