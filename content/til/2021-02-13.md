# tl;dr

Create a Hugo `config.toml` file in your
[`vimwiki`](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) notes directory, set up a
Github action to publish the website to your repository.

# Motivation

I've wanted to share little snippets of things that I have learned. Mostly for
myself, since I tend to forget things.

I'm a sucker for taking notes. I like different types of note taking systems,
ranging from post-it notes and bullet journals to my own [note taking CLI](https://github.com/hectron/nn).

I've been using [`vimwiki`](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) to take notes in
my terminal, and I've really been loving it. It has keyboard shortcuts to make
creating notes and diary entries really easy. It has a pretty slick system to
link similar pages together. It also has the ability to publish your content as
static HTML files. [`vimwiki`](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) really
sold me.
